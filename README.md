120 units/acre -> 13.8 units per 5,000 sq ft

4 stories max w/o an elevator

13 units -> 3 + 3 + 3 + 4?

But I want the bottom floor to have laundry and bike storage, so 1 + 4 + 4 + 4? 1 + 3 + 3 + 3?
Let's say
Ground floor: Tw0 ADA apts?  Bike/stroller storage
2nd floor: 2 bed + 2 bed
3rd floor: 2 bed + 2 bed
4th floor: studio + 1 bed + 1 bed.

| Apartment Type | Average Sq Ft |
|----------------|---------------|
| Studio         | 492           |
| 1-Bedroom      | 677           |
| 2-Bedroom      | 1,059         |
| 3-Bedroom      | 1,301         |

Khrushovka alternated with some floors being Studio, 1, 2, and others being 1, 1, 1.
That would make any basic floor plan 492 + 677 + 1059 or 677 * 3. So 2,200 sq ft not including staircase.

## Appliances

To avoid having to waste space on a laundry room, I could put in heat-pump washer/dryer combos, which are $2,000 apiece.
